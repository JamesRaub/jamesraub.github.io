## The Pitch Competition
I got a later start after a restless sleep and woke up at 11:00am, immediately heading to the innovation hub. As soon as I got there, I was recruited by Josiah to come watch the pitched by the woman who were building their startups at iSpace.

Each of the pitches consisted of a around a 2 minutes demonstration followed by a questions answer, feedback session. I sat back and watched the pitched and held my tongue for the QA session until finally I had a question, which everyone listened intensely too and really seemed to like.

## The Applications
I asked how would the application for TicketX, an online ticketing platform, built by Vanessa would run on mobile to which she said she had not tested it. The text following applications for a catering service, a delivery service, and an event planner service each consisted of a simply made website using Bootstrap, which is a programming style guide, but had no backend functionality.

All of the applications instead of being startups, more or less depicted what their start up would potentially do and while they were all doable ideas they lacked they key component to get them working.

## Giving Guidance
It is not like these ideas were impossible either to implement and many of them just needed a bit of guidance on the backend development which I would happily be providing over my time at iSpace. After asking a lot of questions during the pitches, there were four remaining women left who were not pitching. Josiah remarked to one of the woman there who was balancing a small child in her arms about why she did not present today to which she responded her computer was broken.


## A Line of Questioning
Josiah got a bit frustrated by this question and began stating that he told all of the woman to backup their projects to flash drives in case of this happening and how that if this was a business setting she would be fired, he would fire her.

Josiah also stated,

>â€œShit, I have 3 kids I could be seeing right now, but I am here working. The people needed to stop treating their startups as ideas and take them more seriously, treat them as actually businesses, as means of income."

## Development Meeting
I then had a meeting with Solomon, the head developer, and some of the other developer who will be teaching the class Monday through Friday. Josiah had a talk with all of us about teaching in the classroom and how that would be generally structured and he emphasized that his main job would be to just get us to the site and we should figure out the material.

Solomon and I spoke for a bit and I was able to heavily influence the structure of the course by providing many resources and video lessons that we would be using to teach the class and which we could give to the teachers, such as hourofcode.org, scratch, and Code Academy. I emphasized we wanted to focus on guiding the teachers through tutorials instead of just rogue teaching as this will be something they can refer back to.

## Helping Redesign iSpace's Website
After the talks, Favour, the Program Manager, came over to my desk and asked me how I would redesign both the iSpace website and the Women in Technology business. I focused my responses and integrating a news feed and blog into the iSpace website and to continuously make content which people would be interested in.

Especially appealing to international markets with podcasts and interviews and more long type blog posts as one would find in MIT technology review or Forbes. I also talked about the need for them to market themselves more as an innovation hub in Accra, Ghana and focus on the people aspect of what they are doing, providing more description to the events and batching certain categories together for a generally better understanding. She really appreciated all my advice and one of my ongoing projects will be further developing the website that iSpace currently uses.


## Some Real Change++
I worked for a bit on using react-native, a cross platform development software on my computer, until I had a meeting with Robert,  the Chief Service Officer of the organization we are founding Change++. We read through all the applications after putting them in a google doc and selected which ones we thought would be best suited for project manager, senior developer, designer, service team, and sponsorship team. We selected about 10 applications and sent out emails to all of them inviting them to sign up for a time to interview in the next week for a position. We then came up with the interview questions along with Jarrett, who is my other good friend and the Chief Technology Officer of Change++.

## The Delivery Applicaiton
I then met a bit with the team working on the delivery application to see how the styling of the app was coming along. As well, I started creating the curriculum for next week. I left at 6:45pm and went back and headed out for an evening of Tapas at a local joint with Barry.
