## Swimming
I was awoken at 7:00am by my uncle and quickly got on my bathing suit and prepared to go swimming. We took an uber, which was extraordinarily cheap like everything else in this country to a very large swimming pool in a resort complex. A building like that in the states with all the included add-ons would be extremely costly, but here it is readily available for use and comes at a bargain price.

I did some stretches and swam 30 laps in the pool over the course of an hour taking breaks in between to lay in the sun. If it was not for the bugs in the pool this place would be absolutely majestic. Right next to the pool there was a rubble field and music from the mosque could be heard in the background. A classic African experience.

## Beautiful Code
Afterwards I came back, went to the innovation hub, realized that they did not have lunch their on Saturdays and instead had some tuna and milk at Barry’s. I went back the innovation hub and popped by the Phoenix kids who were working on a robotics project. I sat outside for the rest of the day coding in the sunlight under the trees on with nature and with technology. Why do the two have to be opposites? There is nothing more natural than beautiful code that blends into together and is short, simple, but at the same time extremely complex and intuitive.

## Designing the Curriculum
I designed the curriculum for the classes I would be teaching which included a intro to programming as a whole followed by a intro to web design via HTML and CSS and lastly bringing it together to build an interactive website. The next couple days I will have a large focus on building the backend for websites and utilizing APIs to build awesome projects with code and hopefully we can enable these teachers to build their own tools and inspire the next generation of coder across Ghana. I am going to get the contact information for all these teachers and some of the students so I can continuously check up on them to make sure they are working hard and see if they need any more people. There is something special in the atmosphere here and I want to come back here one day and continue to empower people to implement solutions to their problems.

## All Working Out in the End
For the amount of last minute planning I did and the amount of skepticism associated with this project due to the lack of contact I had with iSpace, this whole project has really been coming together beautifully into a stunning majestic display of coding beauty. I am learning so much about implementing plans and working with people that I can already say this will be the most impactful experience of my life so far. I have been thinking about my future career and the more I think about it the more I realize this is what I want to do.

I want to be on the ground working with people to implement solutions to complex issues, dealing with extremely passionate people every day who care so deeply about the issues they are involved in, showing up on a Saturday to work is not work at all, it is a deep and fulfilling pleasure.

## A Great Barbecue
I finished off the day by heading back to the apartment and going with my uncle to a barbecue at his work colleague’s house where we were met with a beautiful cut of steak and warm hospitality. We took a tour of the apartment complex with an included pool, squash court, tennis court, gym, and a majestic surrounding garden and pathways. Getting up and walking outside of here one feels connected to their surroundings and the African world. We spoke at length at the dinner table about the problems with working in this area, but also the crazy experiences that they have been through and the exciting experiences yet to come.
