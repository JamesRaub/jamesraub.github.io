## People of Ghana
The people of Ghana are reserved, but passionate. Except for when they are trying to get some money from you they keep to themselves but are always ready to engage in a friendly conversation.

This is Africa though and people drive like absolute maniacs. Crossing the street is an insane task only meant for the brave of heart and should be done extremely carefully as to not get hit by any cars.

There are as well plenty of “expats” living in this area working among this culture and being apart of this beautiful environment. The blistering sun while it is very nice causes me to sweat and extreme amount almost to the point of a high-intensity workout. For this reason, I find myself drinking water an insane amount.

I relate strongly with the spirit of this place and the spirit of the people at iSpace. They are hard working individuals who seem to be tirelessly dedicated to the goal of learning these technical skills and creating new things with technology.

**I believe the passion can be further curated and brought to the youth of this country as they seek in fields and unleash the next generation of entrepreneurs onto the world.**

## The CEO of iSpace
Josiah Kwesi Elsia sits surrounded giving a talk to onlooking individuals. He comes to meet me in the room and his presence is electric, a voice, not load but in command, and a style which is truly unprecedented, reminiscing the movie Black Panther, with a ring of an African animal on every finger and traditional African robes but with a modern cut and clean figure. This is the future of Africa.

Along iSpace, one sees a sea of workers typing away at every cervices and groups of people collaborating on the future, quietly.

## Two Hawks and a Chicken
In the back of the room, amongst a sea of tech savy workers, two hawks and a chicken are kept in a cage in the back and Josiah remarks to me,

> I put the chicken in there to see if the hawks would you know, show the chicken they are hawks. But I believe that the hawks may be coming chickens or the chicken becoming a hawk.

This is the story of Ghana will the chickens become a hawk or will the hawks become chickens. Will these individuals creating massive change and upheaval across the continent affect the mass of people living in poverty or will these factors of poverty spread across the continent turning once brilliant eyed beings into dull, ordinary chickens.

## The City of Accra
Accra whilst a city with a large population feels more like a densely populated suburb. It is hard to identify a town square or the high rise buildings which are typical of American cities. Instead one sees people working out of seemingly residential buildings.

People doing great things unbeknownst to the majority working in a domestic setting. Is this a cultural norm or the lack of reaching tall business centers a result of the development in the area. Accra’s traffic is quite terrible and this is a large factor for people driving like complete nutcases.

## Nonconformity
I feel free. I feel free in the sense of nonconformity. Doing what other people are not. To many people in today’s world trying to find meaning but becoming copies of those they want to be. By doing what Elon Musk is doing, one person tries to become Elon Musk, but it is quite the contrary.

One can never become Elon Musk, another individual of the same nature will never exist idealizing those they are trying to copy. A person must strive to be different. Working an innovation hub in Ghana in a complete new culture, in an untouched landscape, in a thriving ecosystem, and amongst a culture rooted in entrepreneurs is freeing.

There is an atmosphere here that I believe one can trace to the industrial revolution, the silicon revolution, the scientific boom of post-World War II, it is an atmosphere of change where men become gods and a group of people become a society driven onward and upward.
