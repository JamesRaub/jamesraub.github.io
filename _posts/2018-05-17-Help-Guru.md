## Work Hard If You Want To
Life in Ghana is what you make of it. Everybody is working, everybody has to have a raison d'etre or else they would be on the streets. People sit outside guarding buildings or teams of people work on doing basic tasks for people with more resources then them. There is always something to be done; people are always working.

The developers at iSpace while they are clearly passionate about the subject are committed full time to this because they have to. It is the reason that Francis did not sleep and it is the reason they find themselves often on the couches at the innovation hub.

Communication is clearly African in its own right. People are loud and they love to laugh, they speak in a way which is completely not understandable from a distance yelling, but talking.

## Entrepreneurship or Business
I overheard an argument by Josiah this morning about the government trying to create jobs through entrepreneurship. Josiah was getting very heated by the fact that the government thought they could boost the economy through entrepreneurship. He was stating that the government should boost the economy by supporting businesses not entrepreneurship. Often time, people leave their business because of entrepreneurship, because they feel so passionately about something it drives them away from their regular work.

Entrepreneurship is a means to an end in that yes entrepreneurs create business, but business and entrepreneurship are often competing frameworks and mindsets, while business are focused on providing jobs entrepreneurs more or less seek on creating products, not jobs, and creating a future service not providing for a current service.


## Ambition and Innovation
The people at iSpace are ambitious, wildly, and they believe in creating awesome products through whatever means and understanding. The lack of fast computers at iSpace does create a problem though. It takes about three times longer to access a search result on one of their computers as opposed to mine. The WiFi is very good at the innovation hub the computers are just extraordinary slow which really adds up over time.

I would love to see this place thrive in terms of technology and I believe the future and it is very motivating for me at least to see so many hard working people at this place toiling away and getting some really shit done. It makes me very happy to work here and I want to do as much as possible and be as useful as possible. I need to focus on a couple of projects which I can really implement. At hackathons, I often built comprehensive solutions to issues and create full-scale application in a 24-hour period and I believe I can pull a lot of all-nighters and get some serious work done with my time here and reach out to as many experts in the field as possible to see what type of help I can get.

## Giving Charity
I spent a large part of my day helping Charity, a mom and aspiring business owner with her Wordpress website, MokoAfrica, which she works with local woman and sells handmade goods at very reasonable prices. It is unbelievable the work she is doing and it was extremely impactful that I was able to help her setup her ECommerce platform and I played a vital role in her future economic success

## The Future
Every time you are stuck on a problem, every time you feel frustrated that you cannot figure something out. Look around you and see potential. The potential for all these low level workers to truly make something of themselves and joining the future world and become **key members in the global economy**
